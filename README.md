# L-System Generative Artwork Generator

This project is a rule-based generative art system using **L-Systems**.  
It generates complex fractal and geometric patterns by repeatedly rewriting an initial axiom
using production rules, then visualizing the result with **turtle graphics (ColabTurtle)**.

This creates multiple different artwork outcomes by: 
- L-System grammars (Square Weave, Hilbert Curve, Dragon Curve)
- Iterations
- Angles
- Color
- Line thickness

## Requirements

This project runs in **Google Colab** or any Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Required Library

- ColabTurtle

```bash
pip install ColabTurtle
```

##How to run the project
###1. Open Notebook in Google Colab
###2. Install dependencies
###3. Run All Code
###4. Generate Outputs
###5. Custom
Change the drawing by editing :
* iterations
* angle
* palette
* color_mode
* thickness_mode
